Both are natural language processing (NLP) models that process the text input by humans and generate coherent and meaningful responses.

Both use deep learning techniques to learn the interesting patterns and relationships between the data.

Both are pre-trained on a large variety of text data that allows them to understand human languages' general patterns and structure.



openAI ChatGPT

Google BERT

ChatGPT is designed to be a chatbot that can carry on conversations like humans.

BERT is designed to perform tasks like named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and question-answering.

ChatGPT generates human-like responses to textual questions using generative transformers. It processes the text in one direction and produces a less context-aware response than BERT.

BERT produces context-aware responses to the textual questions using bidirectional transformers to understand the context of the input text by processing it simultaneously in both directions, i.e., right to left and left to right. (It is for this reason that it's called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). 

ChatGPT is more of a customized model that can be trained on specific use cases.

BERT is more of a general-purpose model and is a less customized model than ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is a good choice when we want a prompt and precise response to a question. For example, retail and customer service businesses can benefit better from ChatGPT.

BERT is a good choice when we require an in-depth comprehension of the context of a sentence. For example, health and finance-related businesses should use BERT. 


such as sentiment analysis, clinical note analysis, and toxic comment detection.

The following is a conversation with an AI research assistant. The assistant tone is technical and scientific.
Human: Hello, who are you?
AI: Greeting! I am an AI research assistant. How can I help you today?
Human: Can you tell me about the creation of blackholes?
AI:

Answer the question based on the context below. Keep the answer short and concise. Respond "Unsure about answer" if not sure about the answer.
Context: Teplizumab traces its roots to a New Jersey drug company called Ortho Pharmaceutical. There, scientists generated an early version of the antibody, dubbed OKT3. Originally sourced from mice, the molecule was able to bind to the surface of T cells and limit their cell-killing potential. In 1986, it was approved to help prevent organ rejection after kidney transplants, making it the first therapeutic antibody allowed for human use.
Question: What was OKT3 originally sourced from?
Answer:




Author-contribution statements and acknowledgements in research papers should state clearly and specifically whether, and to what extent, the authors used AI technologies such as ChatGPT in the preparation of their manuscript and analysis. They should also indicate which LLMs were used. This will alert editors and reviewers to scrutinize manuscripts more carefully for potential biases, inaccuracies and improper source crediting. Likewise, scientific journals should be transparent about their use of LLMs, for example when selecting submitted manuscripts.
